<p>Publishing your plugin on this site is a simple two step process.</p>

<h2>Post-Receive Hook</h2>

<p>First, you'll need to create a post-receive hook on GitHub. Just follow the
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks">step-by-step guide
for adding a webhook</a> and set the URL to
<code>http://plugins.jquery.com/postreceive-hook</code>. Now you're ready to publish
your plugin.</p>

<h2>Adding a Manifest</h2>

<p>The jQuery Plugins Registry will look in the root level of your repository for any files named <code>*.jquery.json</code>.  You will want to create <code><em>yourplugin</em>.jquery.json</code> according to the <a href="/docs/package-manifest/">package manifest specification</a>.

<h2>Publishing a Version</h2>

<p>After the post-receive hook is setup and your manifest has been added, publishing your plugin is as simple as tagging the version in git and pushing the tag to GitHub. The post-receive hook will notify the plugins site that a new tag is available and the plugins site will take care of the rest!</p>

<p>The name of the tag <strong>must</strong> be a valid
<a href="http://semver.org/">semver</a> value. The tag name may contain an
optional <code>v</code> prefix. The tag name must also match the version listed
in the manifest file. If the manifest file is valid, then the version will be
automatically added to the plugins site.</p>

<h2>Having Trouble?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately we do not currently have a system for notifying you if there is
a problem. If you're interested in helping improve this aspect of the plugins
site, we'd <a href="https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/11">love
your help</a>.</p>

<p>If you encounter trouble getting this process to work with your plugin, please join the IRC channel <a href="irc://freenode.net:6667/#jquery-content">#jquery-content</a> on freenode.  If you can't seem to connect with someone in the IRC channel, please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:plugins@jquery.com">plugins@jquery.com</a>.</p>
